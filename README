Description:

NumericalAnalyzer:
In this exercise we had to calculate the integral and derivative values of given functions.
Using assert and error handling we had to prevent the program from doing errors.
The input from the user was made through analyzing the line, parsing each to to it's double
or int value and sending it to the infi library to get back the values for the output.
I dealt with the errors using a global error variable, which would change it's value in case
one of the conditions would cause an error. Also, a check if one of the points would cause
a NaN was made in order to mark invalid input.

infi:
In this library, two methods are implemented - integration and derivative.
integration - this function uses another function to get the centers for each rectangle using
Riemann's sum. It them runs on all of them, calculates the value of the function, multiply
in the delta and returns the sum, by definition it's the integration value of the function between
the segment [a,b].
derivative - this function simply calculates the value of the function in x0+h and x0-h and
uses the definition of the derivation to get the value of the slope in x0 with epsilon h.
If one of the values are NaN, it will cause an assertion error.
